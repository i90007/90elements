            "name": "Source of Everything. Freedom",
            "description": "The boundless possibilities of this source of all existence can only be compared to its infinite inertia and apathy. It serves as the foundation for other energies, but like dark matter, it only manifests itself upon interaction with other forces. It is absolute indifference, yet it can fill any endeavor with inexhaustible energy. One only needs to set a direction. All roads are open, and any fantasy is possible - this is the true joker. Simply make a wish and take action - everything is in your hands. Nothing can stop your vector of movement. The alpha and omega, the root of everything, the father and mother of any fantasy, existence, and non-existence in one essence. This is the only element that can instantly create any universe you can imagine and, in the next moment, destroy it as if it never existed. It could‚Ä¶ but it won‚Äôt. Because it doesn‚Äôt care. The eternal guardian of balance, the king of elements, or simply a sloth. Let nothing disturb its endless meditation."
        },
        "1": {
            "name": "Absolute of Eternal Life",
            "description": "Survive at any cost. If you ask this element, 'What is the meaning of life?', it will ironically reply, 'What is the meaning of death?' If nothing has meaning, then let it be life. This element is like grass growing through asphalt and concrete, but unlike ordinary grass, it cannot be killed. Some may call it weeds, but living weeds are better than dead flowers. This element is a true elixir of eternal life. In the teachings of 'Nante-Namar', there is a symbol for this absolute - the 'Key of Eternal Life.'"
        },
        "2": {
            "name": "Absolute of Fusion",
            "description": "Or the absolute of possession. Here arises the understanding of what is mine and what is not, where I am and where I am not. What is the point of something existing if I cannot possess it? Everything that exists must belong to me, or rather, be me. And if it is already mine, then, of course, I will take care of it, for it is a part of me. I am what I own. I feel that the world exists only because it is mine. My heart is not truly mine until I understand it as part of myself. This absolute erases the boundaries between ownership and personality. Everything you accept as yours becomes you. But do you own it, or does it own you? In human culture, it manifests through dualistic worldviews."
        },
        "3": {
            "name": "Absolute Chaos",
            "description": "The chaotic movement of this element can shift anything from a deadlock. Any structure will be turned into pure energy, like a blender, which will then serve as nourishment for something new. In Egyptian mythology, this energy is represented by Isfet‚Äîembodying this absolute."
        },
        "4": {
            "name": "Absolute Order/Structure",
            "description": "This world is so chaotic, let‚Äôs organize everything and put it on shelves. Mathematics is the queen of sciences; it can encase any phenomenon of being in numbers and formulas. Mathematics and numbers are manifestations of this absolute. Without order, evolution is impossible. This is the embodiment of the cosmic law of Ma'at."
        },
        "5": {
            "name": "Absolute Uniqueness",
            "description": "The universe is so gray and dull. Why does it exist at all? Let‚Äôs give everything the impulse of self-expression. There should be no copies. Every person, animal, tree, and stone will now be unique and strive for distinction. What can this be compared to? ...Perhaps it resembles a worldwide LGBTQ movement‚Äîall the colors of the rainbow and beyond. Individuality for the sake of individuality. In such a colorful variety, even the grayest and most inconspicuous entity will look special. Tastes are not to be argued about; everyone will find their own. The closest analogy in human culture is Hunab Ku, the divine principle of the Maya peoples."
        },
        "6": {
            "name": "Absolute Perfection of Form",
            "description": "I am the world. Self-love is a mandatory attribute of acquiring perfection in individual consciousness and its form. I am perfection itself, the embodied ideal, my beauty is flawless. This means I deserve the best in this world‚Äîeverything I desire. Otherwise, why do I strive and work on myself? I am the only beautiful thing in this world. If someone thinks otherwise, they lie and must be destroyed. Egoism? - Perhaps. But where have you seen an ugly egoist or a non-egoistic beauty? This element gives you the opportunity to achieve perfection, but you must be ready to sacrifice everything and everyone. The whole world is just our toy. Self-realization through beauty and self-admiration is a necessary step toward transforming oneself into an ideal. To reach perfection, one must acknowledge oneself as the center of this process. Otherwise, it is no longer absolute, but merely a tendency toward harmony. The closest analogy in human culture is Taoism."
        },
        "7": {
            "name": "Absolute Perfectionism",
            "description": "I accept the existence of any manifestations in this world, but they must be flawless. Unlike the egoistic 'Absolute 6', we are ready to sacrifice ourselves for the beauty of the universe. Perfectionism is the manifestation of beauty in everything. Our credo: 'Beauty will save the world'. There is still no good or evil‚Äîonly beauty and ugliness, which must be fought. Let the whole universe be like a masterpiece of art or a masterpiece of technical thought. But perfection always demands sacrifices. A parallel can be drawn with the Holy Spirit in Christianity."
        },
        "8": {
            "name": "Absolute Synergy",
            "description": "Sure, you can do everything alone, but why? Together we are strong and capable of incredible results. Let‚Äôs unite around something or someone and implement a project. It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind. Being alone is sad and lonely‚Äîthankfully, there are like-minded people with whom it is fun to create and destroy. One is not a warrior in the field. A single person is easy to break, but a group is much harder. The closest analogy in human culture is the Eight Gods of Fortune in Shintoism."
        },
        "9": {
            "name": "Absolute of Meanings",
            "description": "We seem to have everything to realize any idea, but what if there is no meaning in it? This element gives the initial cause, ideas, meanings, inspiration, and projects for any activity. It is the complete opposite of Element '0', which can do everything but wants nothing. Here, it‚Äôs the other way around‚Äîwe have boundless imagination and the desire to do something, and we even know what exactly, like no one else. But do we have the resources for anything? And are there any willing participants? There was once a land of councils where everyone knew what to do and could help with advice. Advice, but nothing more. In our world, we can approach this element through philosophy. Everything has a cause and effect. We often see the effect but do not always recognize the cause. The closest analogy in human culture is the Akashic Records."
        },
        "10": {
            "name": "Element of the Winner",
            "description": "'Winning isn't everything‚Äîit's the only thing.' Victory at all costs. Those blessed by this energy will never know defeat. Only the result matters, and all means to achieve it are justified. No compromises‚Äîimposing one's will in any situation. Failure is simply not an option. Even if, for variety, you wish to let someone win, you won't succeed. This element ensures first place in everything. But victory can sometimes be Pyrrhic‚Ä¶"
        },
        "11": {
            "name": "Element of Will",
            "description": "Here, the focus is not on the result but on the journey‚Äîeverything must submit to my will. Aggression, strength, arrogance, militancy, and stubbornness define this energy. One must conquer the world, dominate all, and destroy all obstacles. Unbreakable determination and unwavering intent. My will is not just a tool for achieving goals but a way of life, the only value in this world. Only my intent determines the order of things. Either my way or not at all. Even if it's wrong, it must be my way. The outcome doesn‚Äôt matter!"
        },
        "12": {
            "name": "Element of Expansion",
            "description": "One must be bigger, stronger, and penetrate everywhere possible. This energy is like a virus, multiplying uncontrollably and striving to occupy all available space. I must be everywhere. This energy also represents scaling and overcoming obstacles. If you have limitations, this energy helps to break through them. It symbolizes growth, advancement, and reaching the next level."
        },
        "13": {
            "name": "Element of Destruction",
            "description": "Tearing down is easier than building. But to create something new, the old must first be destroyed. Sometimes destruction is exhilarating. Let‚Äôs first clear the site, level the sandbox, and maybe later something new will be built. Or maybe not. Either way, it‚Äôs not our concern."
        },
        "14": {
            "name": "Element of Domination",
            "description": "We shall conquer this world to bring order to all corners of the universe. The eternal empire will shine in its zenith of glory, and nothing shall compare to its perfection. A perfect despotism. Every grain of sand, every person must become a cog in the system. If there are still barbarians somewhere, we will conquer them. If creativity exists, it must be systematized and fit within strict boundaries to serve the greater mechanism. For such is the will of the emperor and the purpose of the ideal empire."
        },
        "15": {
            "name": "Element of Cultural Expansion",
            "description": "Sometimes, on the runways of high fashion, one can see very strange things. Some architects design boldly. Art is subjective. But fashion follows its own rules and laws. Worlds can be conquered by fire and sword, but also by masterpieces of literature, music, etiquette, language, religion, rituals, and traditions. Let us impose our culture on these savages."
        },
        "16": {
            "name": "Element of Ego",
            "description": "Absolute confidence, self-admiration. What is good for me is good for all. I am the smartest and the most beautiful. Maybe that‚Äôs not true, but I don‚Äôt care. I refuse to change because I see no reason to‚Äîlet others adjust to me, for I am kind. Other people's opinions have no value. Sometimes, to stand firm and find strength, you must disregard others and listen only to your desires. I am a slave to my desires, but only they bring me satisfaction, and thus, they are the meaning of life."
        },
        "17": {
            "name": "Element of Dogma",
            "description": "The light of truth shall penetrate every corner of the universe, even if no one asks for it. Many opinions may exist, but truth is singular. This energy is like a missionary following the conqueror, preaching its undeniable principles. Perhaps the Crusades were inspired by this energy."
        },
        "18": {
            "name": "Element of Family",
            "description": "This is family in a mafia sense ‚Äî a clan, sect, or gang. Your own people are those within your circle, while the rest are enemies. For your own, everything; for outsiders, nothing. Only this way can survival be ensured. True brotherhood."
        },
        "19": {
            "name": "Element of Focusing",
            "description": "The philosophy of achievement and perseverance. Die if you must, but accomplish your goal. This is obsession with results, bordering on madness or fanaticism. The focus is locked on one objective. Concentration is a great strength, but excessive fixation on one thing may lead to losses in others. We are prepared for sacrifices‚Äîthe goal justifies the means."
        },
        "20": {
            "name": "Element of Abundance",
            "description": "This element is the very embodiment of the cornucopia. An inexhaustible source of all blessings that one can imagine. Have you heard the legend of Midas? Well, that is but a pale shadow of what this energy represents."
        },
        "21": {
            "name": "Element of Reproduction",
            "description": "If we have everything, isn't it time to think about offspring? Let our children be our continuation, our legacy. We will live forever through our descendants! Or perhaps we establish a business, a grand venture that embodies our essence. Sometimes, our life‚Äôs work feels like our own child."
        },
        "22": {
            "name": "Element of Consumption",
            "description": "An insatiable desire to consume and accumulate everything in existence. An endless hunger and thirst, a black hole pulling everything in. Who knows, perhaps within a black hole lies an entirely new and unique world. We need all the resources of the universe for our survival and growth."
        },
        "23": {
            "name": "Element of Adaptation",
            "description": "Sometimes, conditions for survival are unfavorable, but this element ensures perfect adaptability to any challenges. The organism that knows how to adjust will always survive and succeed. This energy helps to escape any predicament."
        },
        "24": {
            "name": "Element of Preservation",
            "description": "The only value here is not to lose what has already been gained. We are satisfied with what we have‚Äîlet us just preserve it. Resources and wealth must be guarded. This element also relates to fate, time, stability, cycles, history, and memory. In Greek mythology, the Titan Cronus represents this force."
        },
        "25": {
            "name": "Element of Self-Reflection",
            "description": "The sole purpose here is to answer the question, 'Who am I?' Who am I, and why am I in this world? What is the meaning of my existence, and what makes me unique? What sets me apart from others and why? A journey of self-discovery and endless reflection upon the self."
        },
        "26": {
            "name": "Element of Self-Love",
            "description": "Love begins here. The most fundamental and ancient form of love is self-love. We cannot truly love anyone or anything until we love ourselves. The harmony of inner self-acceptance is key."
        },
        "27": {
            "name": "Element of Self-Realization",
            "description": "What is my dharma and nature? What is my purpose? What should I do? Do I have a calling? If so, what is it? This element helps find oneself and one's path or points toward attaining perfect mastery."
        },
        "28": {
            "name": "Element of Alliances",
            "description": "Let‚Äôs find like-minded individuals. Is there anyone in this world who will not be our enemy and can become our ally? Maybe we will unite based on physical similarities, shared interests, or a common goal. Perhaps we have a mutual adversary or an unwanted factor? This is not friendship or love, but rather a mutually beneficial partnership. And often, the benefit is one-sided. 'Nothing personal‚Äîjust business.'"
        },
        "29": {
            "name": "Element of Personal Interest",
            "description": "What is our benefit, and do I have a plan? What do I want, and what is the meaning of my existence? There must always be a desire, a direction, a purpose in life. My path must be unique and chosen without doubt. And it is, it always is. But everyone has their own. This element represents a self-sufficient worldview that requires no adjustments."
        },
        "30": {
            "name": "Element of Change",
            "description": "The motto of this energy: 'Movement is life!' And movement means constant change. Not for the sake of perfection, but change for change‚Äôs sake, to avoid stagnation. An endless space of possibilities, all of which must be explored. And if, by some miracle, we manage to try them all (which is impossible), we will start again. Some people love switching TV channels so much that they enjoy the act of switching more than watching the programs themselves. 'Clip thinking' is also about this."
        },
        "31": {
            "name": "Element of Eternal Search",
            "description": "An endless labyrinth of possibilities. TikTok, Tinder‚Äîthis is their essence. The eternal pursuit of the best, which may not even exist. Here, it‚Äôs not about searching for the sake of searching, but for the goal. But how attainable is that goal? If there is a plan of action but no result, what do we get? Experience! This is the most experienced element‚Äîno matter what you do, this element already knows how it will end. It‚Äôs like the girl from the movie 'Interstate 60' who was endlessly searching for the perfect sexual partner. Experience has value, and a great one at that."
        },
        "32": {
            "name": "Element of Innovation",
            "description": "The birth of breakthrough ideas. We already have the necessary experience and a vision of what the result should be. Now we just need to develop a plan and take action. This element helps inventors, innovators, researchers, and scientists. There is no practicality or feasibility yet, only pure creativity. Science can also be an art. But this is not only about science."
        },
        "33": {
            "name": "Element of Transformation",
            "description": "Or the element of death. Death here is meant in the broadest sense of the word‚Äîas the fading away of something old or cleansing from the unnecessary. Suppose we already have a specific plan, the strength, determination, and even resources. But if you want to bring something new into life, you must first get rid of the clutter and all that is superfluous. Before building a new house, you must clear the site by demolishing the old one. Before starting a new relationship, you must let go of the previous one. To enter a new stage in life, you must end the previous one. This closely resembles the Hindu god Shiva."
        },
        "34": {
            "name": "Element of Renewal",
            "description": "You have everything needed to start a new life, a new stage, project, etc. Now, all that remains is to take action! The time has come; there will never be a more opportune moment. The situation has fully matured, and the world is ready for change. This element favors anyone trying to bring something new into old systems. Don't be afraid‚Äîthere will be little resistance. And if there is, it will be insignificant. The initial result may not be perfect, but that‚Äôs okay‚Äîit can be improved later. The 'apartment renovation' was definitely worth it. This is a symbol of the beginning of a new life or a new phase."
        },
        "35": {
            "name": "Element of Adaptation",
            "description": "Or conformism. You can't please everyone or foresee every possible emergency‚Äîit's impossible. Especially when faced with radical changes. But this element states that over time, the new system will settle in, and sharp edges can be smoothed. The changes have begun; now, they just need to be made accessible to everyone. The new system must be flexible, universal, and ready for any challenges. This isn‚Äôt easy, but it‚Äôs entirely possible. The old system is gone, and the new one has successfully replaced it‚Äînow, we just need to adapt to it or adapt it to others."
        },
        "36": {
            "name": "Element of Fine-Tuning",
            "description": "Let‚Äôs make the changes 'turnkey' so that even the most demanding and spoiled subject is satisfied. Any product or service can be tailored so precisely to a picky client‚Äôs needs that they will be delighted. Any conservative will be disarmed by such an ideal personalized approach. In marketing, they say: 'Just take the client‚Äôs problem and solve it'. And that‚Äôs exactly what will happen. You can't create something universal that suits everyone, but you can make a unique solution for each individual, eliminating all flaws. This element is about innovation being so convenient and adapted to a specific case that it becomes irresistible."
        },
        "37": {
            "name": "Element of Optimization",
            "description": "Everything works perfectly, but what about the costs? Can we make it cheaper, take less time, or use fewer resources? How far can we go in optimizing something? That‚Äôs what we need to find out, because at this stage, it‚Äôs crucial. The details are what matter most."
        },
        "38": {
            "name": "Element of Competition",
            "description": "This is also the element of rivalry, of competition for self-improvement. Competitions can be athletic or otherwise. Competition helps to reveal the best. This element does not necessarily manifest as a struggle between business sharks. Children playing soccer in the yard are also competing, but their motivation is entirely different‚Äîthey simply play for the joy of it. This element requires no motivation. 'Winning isn't the goal‚Äîparticipation is.'"
        },
        "39": {
            "name": "Element of Anarchy",
            "description": "Anarchy is the mother of order. Hidden harmony, the highest form of freedom. Freedom and innovation must be taken to the absolute. This will become our new religion or our new scientific doctrine. Chaos can be mathematically precise and necessary, philosophically speaking. Anarchy is not disorder; it is a level of organization so complex that few can perceive a system within it. But it exists! Freedom is not the opposite of order, but its highest form. Only what arises without coercion is true. This element denies all authorities, hierarchies, and externally imposed rules. It creates order without commands, harmony without directives. But can you handle it? Because without external control, there is only you and your ability to take responsibility for your own world."

        "40": {
            "name": "Element of Stability",
            "description": "Everything new, everything different from us‚Äîis an act of aggression towards us. We do not like white crows; we do not need them. Everything is already perfect‚Äîno need to change anything, let everything remain as it is. Forever! Why should we deal with chaos, destruction, and turmoil? They only bring trouble. If everything is already good, why change anything?"
        },
        "41": {
            "name": "Element of Punishment",
            "description": "This element embodies the philosophy of any penitentiary system. If there is a rebel, a criminal, or simply a disturber of peace, they must be punished. Preferably harshly and demonstratively. Not because we are cruel, but because it is necessary‚Äîfor the sake of others‚Äô discipline. Otherwise, someone else might also get the idea to challenge us."
        },
        "42": {
            "name": "Element of Isolation",
            "description": "Sometimes, to achieve the best results, sterile isolated conditions are required. Isolation can also help preserve our uniqueness in its original form. Conducting certain important experiments often requires special conditions so that nothing and no one can interfere with the process or influence the results."

            "name": "Element of Coercion/Surveillance",
            "description": "This is both the carrot and the stick. Coercion is an instrument of domination. This is not about a system of punishments but rather about a system of rewards and penalties. Soft power can be far more effective than brute force. Were you a good boy? Here‚Äôs a bonus. Were you a bad girl? Here‚Äôs a system of fines and restrictions. This is a system of total surveillance that does not require harsh measures because any disobedience can be eliminated at its root."
        },

            "name": "Element of Precision",
            "description": "Precision is the politeness of kings! This is the absolute of systematization in everything. No liberties. Act only according to the specified rules and submit properly completed reports on time. But absolute precision can lead to paranoia. A lack of precision leads to mistakes."

        "45": {
            "name": "Element of Bureaucracy",
            "description": "Every process, event, or system component must be standardized. Every object or phenomenon must have its own regulation and instruction. Any process in a corporation or state must be strictly regulated so that everyone knows exactly what to do in every situation. If something unusual happens, a new rule or instruction must be created immediately; otherwise, chaos ensues."
        },
        "46": {
            "name": "Element of Immunity",
            "description": "This element protects law enforcement and the army. In a commercial structure, this pertains to security services or corporate protection. Any outsider must be immediately identified and neutralized. Those who come at us with a sword shall perish by the sword. Any structure must have teeth and be able to defend itself, just as the immune system of a biological organism always guards against bacteria, viruses, and other threats."

We have forces for external enemies, but who will fight internal ones? This element is necessary for self-discipline, self-improvement, and optimizing internal processes."

        "48": {
            "name": "Element of Collective Decision-Making",
            "description": "Or the element of consensus. If our structure is a family, then there should be a family council that makes decisions so that there is a balance of different points of view. Or perhaps it‚Äôs a blockchain-based system‚Äîeither way, the principle remains the same. A well-established decision-making practice must exist. Even if one subject makes the decision, their opinion is still influenced by the collective. Consensus is necessary for any decision, or the system will not last long."

It can be vast, involving billions, or a small sect with just a thousand followers. At its core is the doctrine, a guiding philosophy, rather than just a spiritual leader.
